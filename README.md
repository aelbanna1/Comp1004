In conclusion the quality outputs require a quality process to be followed. A crucial principle in this section is that of developing software systems in an efficient and systematic manner. Software development can be seen by the novice as something that should be quite simple, yet we hear of projects that are delayed, beset by problems, or indeed we find ourselves with bad quality software that wasn’t planned well and executed incorrectly. In some cases, it can have a bad effect on the project as a whole


The issues and constraints there are many from equipment to personal skills. The constraints that I have for this project is that the internet at home isn’t the greatest and a lot of the times the internet just stops working. This is a massive issue for this project is because when I try to either upload, research or develop and the internet stops we’d lose the progress we make, and stop can go wrong or malfunctions. The way around it is using the university facilities to my advantage to research, upload or develop the project.
Another issue is the design aspect of things. What I mean by that is that I’m not bad at designing but I could design something that could be way over complicated for my skills set. Most of the time I make a design that looks good, but I could struggle to implement it to the development stage. A way to fix it is to make a simple design and because we are using the Agile module we can go back to the design and change things up if I can. 
Lastly is time management. Time management is very important because we a time set for us to plan and develop the project and if we try to do to much that could affect the project as a whole, and when something goes wrong last minute it is very hard to fix it without the stress factor because you try fix it without thinking it throw it.
